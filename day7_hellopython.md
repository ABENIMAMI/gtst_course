* history of python 
* why python is used in hacking 
* how install python 
* what is IDE abd code editors 
* creating python script file 
* output and comments 
* variable and datatype 


# waht is programming language

* it is lanuguage which help to communicate with computers [thet have mot able to understnad human language]
* computers have this language to 
    * assmbily c,c++,java,javascript,python,ruby,perl

# what is proram ?

* a program is an algorithm expressed in a programming language.
* tequnicalily an algorithm must reach a result after infinte number of steps
* with tohse steps programs do a specific tasks correctly

# algorithm example 

* to ask someone his/her name
    * you walk to the person 
    * greethings 
    * wait to answer back
    * "what is your name?"
* this will be a lot of kinds of algoritm to do specific task

# evlations of I/O [input/output]

* earily in the history of computing,programs were submitted on ounch cards with all the data they required and excuted to gethre with other program that used the same liberaries. outputwasto a line printer

# Genrations of computers 

1, first genrations: vacuume tubes => punch cards 

2, secound genrations: transitors => programming staretd here with assembily 

3, third genrations: integretd circuit => **basic, cobol, pascal, fortran, ......

4 fourth genrations: microprocessor => python,SQL,Maltlab

5, fifth genrations: artifctical intelgence 


# type of programming language 

* computers understand binary(0/1), humans dont undersatnd this 
* so based on the clodeness of the language to humans we classify into 3
* the more they become low to they are fatser.
* the more they become like human language they are slower.

**A, Low level programming language** 

* these language are more like manchine but lots os effort people can understand them. they are close to the hardware of the computer 
* example
    * assmbily 

**B, high level programming language**

* they are more colse to human language 
* example 
    * python,c++,java,js.....

**c, medium level** 

* language between low level, and high level combine both 
* example 
    * c-lang 


# uses of programming laguage 

* android application developemnt 
* website development 
* machine learing 
* artficial intelligence 
* game development 
* big data technology 
* desktop softwere development 
* hacking tools development 

# why are python programming ?

* python is a high level & interpreted programming lamguage 
* its very smplified language any one can write it also can read it

# use of python 


* data visualization 
* data analysis
* machine learnnig 
* artificial intellignce 
* game development 
* hacking tools

# install python 

**wbsite** 

    *https://www.python.org/

# IDE & Code editors

* IDE(integrated devlopment enviroment)is softwere that helps to write & run specific programming language example pythonIDE

* code editor: are softwere those can help to write any kind of programming language and also by addng some complilng/interpreting feature they can run programs/scripts example:sublime,vscode

# output and comments 

* on python to display output we keyword 'print'
* syntax "print (object ='', sep='', end='')



# comments

* this are simple notes wrriten on our code those can help as to remember the function of code or to make it simple for people to understand our code 
* commnets wnont be executed 
* syntax # this is a acomment line
